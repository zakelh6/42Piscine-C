## üó£Ô∏è About 42

	42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
	no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a
	methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is
	approved in its selection process. The so-called "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp,
	is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student).
  
  ## Skills developed at C Piscine

### üõ†Ô∏è Hard-skills
	# C Language
		The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
		pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
		including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

	# Shell
		The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
		shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

	# Git
		All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
		be at ease with such a system.

### Soft-skills
	# Self-learning and proactiveness
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
		chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
		The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
		common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
		they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not
		"drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.
